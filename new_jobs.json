We help countries develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience to sustain development results. UNDP has been present in Malawi since 1964. Working closely with the Government of Malawi, civil society and the private sector, UNDP’ s work aims to contribute to economic growth, sustainable environmental management, and democratic governance and accountability in Malawi. UNDP’s Country Programme Document is closely aligned to the Malawi Agenda 2063 and supports Malawi’s aim to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. UNDP ‘s programme is designed to address the interlinked issues of poverty, inequality and vulnerability to shocks and is managed within two portfolios: Responsive Institutions and Citizen Engagement which works towards strengthening effective, accountable and inclusive governance that promotes civic engagement, respect for human rights, rule of law, peace and democracy. It also works towards strengthening data generation and analysis. Resilience and Sustainable Growth which focusses on enhancing economic innovation, inclusive business, job creation, and renewable energy access.

We help countries develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience to sustain development results. UNDP has been present in Malawi since 1964. Working closely with the Government of Malawi, civil society and the private sector, UNDP’ s work aims to contribute to economic growth, sustainable environmental management, and democratic governance and accountability in Malawi. UNDP’s Country Programme Document is closely aligned to the Malawi Agenda 2063 and supports Malawi’s aim to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. UNDP ‘s programme is designed to address the interlinked issues of poverty, inequality and vulnerability to shocks and is managed within two portfolios: Responsive Institutions and Citizen Engagement which works towards strengthening effective, accountable and inclusive governance that promotes civic engagement, respect for human rights, rule of law, peace and democracy. It also works towards strengthening data generation and analysis. Resilience and Sustainable Growth which focusses on enhancing economic innovation, inclusive business, job creation, and renewable energy access. It also works towards helping Malawi adapt to climate change and build resilience to disasters.ContextUNDP Malawi Country Office (CO) has re-focused its efforts to support innovation, knowledge management and an evidence-based approach to enhance UNDP’s leadership as a thought leader in the implementation of the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development and the Malawi 2063 vision and its 10-year Implementation plan (MIP 1) anchored by the UNDP Strategic Plan 2023 to 2025. Within this context, the Development Impact Advisory Team (DIAT) was established to enhance development effectiveness by improving systems, tools and mechanisms for national policy and strategy planning, management, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.

The following are the specific objectives;To monitor routine programmatic results, which can provide valuable feedback and allow for timely decision-making.To track programmatic performance over time, allowing CO to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.To promote accountability by providing a transparent and accessible way to monitor programmatic results.To improve decision-making by enabling CO to quickly identify areas that require attention or improvement by providing a clear and concise visual representation of programmatic results.To visualize presentations of data, making it easier to understand and analyze to help facilitate communication among stakeholders.SCOPE OF WORK:Geographic scope: This dashboard will utilize secondary routine monitoring data collected at the national and district levels (9th CPD focus districts and districts funded from other resources).\nCurrent Programme Cycle: 2024-2028Proposed Methodology of the M&R DashboardA consultant is expected to lead the design and implementation of the M&R system liaising with the UNFPA team, and leading data collection (including training and development of protocols and instruments necessary to operationalize the dashboard).\nThe consultant is also expected to develop a detailed methodology, data collection tool, and user friendly reporting template including a roadmap for discussion with UNFPA. Secondary quantitative data extracted from project documents and government routine data collection systems are expected to be utilized. A comprehensive desk-based review of the existing secondary databases will include indicators related to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), Adolescent and Youth SRH, Gender, and Humanitarian.\nThe consultant will develop the M&R dashboard using the PowerBI platform system, template for data collection and documentation of the secondary data. The consultant is also expected to elaborate on the methodology that will be employed, including appropriate stages that will be employed when developing the prototype. He/She is expected to train and transfer the knowledge to UNFPA’s staff on how to re-develop and manage the PowerBI M & R dashboard system, upload, manage, navigate and effectively disseminate the data on the dashboard.Expected outputs and deliverables:Design Phase: The design phase will define the clear objectives and scope of the M&R dashboard, IPs’ data matrix reports, work plan progress reports, and UNFPA Training and Monitoring Visits Trackers. The phase will also involve planning, integration, developing the architecture including layout, user interface, and visualization tools, create a data collection plan with tools and methods, establish data management protocols, engage stakeholders for input and feedback, and prepare a presentation slide deck of the inception report for validation by the project stakeholder group.Implementation Phase: The implementation phase involves building the M&R dashboard with real-time data updates and user-friendly features, integrating data from various sources, training staff, drafting and finalizing a user-friendly manual, conducting rigorous testing and quality assurance, and iterating based on user feedback to enhance functionality and usability.Reporting and dissemination phase: The reporting phase involves generating and distributing regular reports to stakeholders, documenting best practices and lessons learned, conducting a comprehensive year-end evaluation, reflecting on the dashboard’s effectiveness, planning for improvements, and producing a professionally formatted final report with recommendations and a presentation slide deck, followed by a stakeholder validation workshop.General Terms and ConditionsAll reports and documents prepared during the assignment shall be treated as property of UNFPA Malawi CO.

By having real-time access to data and insights, program managers and stakeholders will be better equipped to make timely and evidence-based decisions.Improved Program Performance: With a systematic monitoring and evaluation framework in place, the expected outcome is an overall improvement in program performance. This includes achieving project goals, meeting milestones, and ensuring the efficient use of resources.Increased Accountability: The M&R dashboard will foster greater accountability among project stakeholders. By transparently tracking progress and outcomes, it becomes easier to assign responsibility, track performance, and address any issues that arise promptly. Enhanced Communication: The dashboard’s ability to consolidate data and present it in a user-friendly format is expected to improve communication among project teams and partners. It will enable programme, management and operations team members to have a shared understanding of project status and progress.Effective Resource Allocation: The dashboard will assist in optimizing resource allocation by highlighting areas where resources are needed most. This leads to a more efficient utilization of funds and assets. Alignment with Strategic Goals: One of the expected outcomes is ensuring alignment between the 9th CPD and the new strategic plan for 2022-2025. This alignment will contribute to a more coherent and impactful approach to achieving program objectives.Targeted Interventions: Through the analysis of disaggregated data, the dashboard will enable targeted interventions, ensuring that vulnerable populations, such as specific age groups or individuals with disabilities, receive the support they need.Learning and Adaptation: The M&R dashboard is expected to facilitate a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. When data reveals challenges or opportunities, project teams can make adjustments to strategies and activities for better results.Increased Stakeholder Engagement: As the dashboard promotes transparency and accountability, it is anticipated to lead to increased engagement and commitment from stakeholders, including donors, government agencies, and implementing partners.Timely Reporting: The dashboard will streamline the reporting process, making it easier to provide timely updates to donors and other stakeholders.Sustainability: By tracking progress and challenges systematically, the M&R dashboard contributes to the long-term sustainability of programs and initiatives.
