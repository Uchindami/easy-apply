To help them fulfill their potential. \nAcross 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone. \nAnd we never give up. \nFor every child, Education \nThe fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, advocacy, and operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.\nUNICEF Tajikistan CO conducted a school readiness assessment as a part of the measurement framework of quality PPE in Tajikistan. To measure school readiness, UNICEF CO used an adapted version of the internationally recognized International Development and Early Learning Assessment (IDELA) measurement tools, which should not have limited applicability to children with disabilities. The measurement of school readiness occurred across five domains of child development based on the national Early Learning Development Standards, including\n1) Physical health and motor development. 2) Social and emotional development. 3) Approaches to learning: 4) Language development. 5) Cognitive development and general knowledge.\nThis data should demonstrate developmental domains children are benefiting least and most from. This information shall inform evidence-based decision making, address critical needs and adaptations and changes in the curriculum, teaching practices and parental engagement, and trigger policy dialogue about advancing and reforming the primary education curriculum.\nThe assignment is aligned to the National Education Development Strategy 2030, which aims to accelerate enrolment of children in quality pre-primary education (PPE). The assignment is also aligned with UNICEF Country Programme 2023-2026 (E/ICEF/2022/P/L.29). It addresses the urgent need for strengthening national systems at central and local level to deliver quality, inclusive and affordable PPE services for all children. It also addresses the need to strengthen access to pre-primary resources and awareness of the availability of these resources that support young children’s school readiness skills in Tajikistan. Therefore, young children’s school readiness skills will be one primary unit of measurement, looking across five domains of early childhood development (ECD) mentioned above.\nUNICEF and Save the Children USA entered into partnership for the use of the IDELA Toolkit, whose adapted version was selected to collect data for the school readiness assessment /pre-primary learning outcomes. IDELA toolkits have been adapted and translated into Tajik language within the scope of this study in coordination with the locally recruited research firm, implementing the fieldwork.\nAdditionally, training of Master Trainers took place for 9 master trainers, coming from various regions of the country attended the full training and practiced on the instruments. Following the enumerators training conducted in early January 2025, data collection conducted and with significant data available to do the analysis/finalize the report. The study’s results will allow identifying key inequities preventing children in Tajikistan from attaining school readiness, inform evidence-based interventions, address critical needs and potential adaptations/changes in the curriculum, teaching practices and parental engagement, and trigger policy dialogue about advancing and reforming the primary education curriculum.\nHow can you make a difference? \nDESCRIPTION OF THE ASSIGNMENT:\nDuration: 15 working days between June 2025 - July 2025Supervisor: Education Officer, UNICEF Tajikistan\nWithin this context, UNICEF is seeking a qualified international individual consultant to support to analyse the baseline data collected by the local research company through the four IDELA tools/datasets – CFM: IDELA Child Functioning Module - HE: IDELA Home Environment/Caregiver - CA: IDELA Child Assessment - CE: IDEL-A Classroom Environment and produce a final report on the baseline study results on the Tajikistan School Readiness Assessment.\nTime frame and planning:The recommended time frame for the execution of this consultancy is approximately 6-8 weeks during June and July 2025, taking into account the time needed for data analysis and the review and feedback stages by UNICEF:A.

    "jobDescription": "L'UNICEF travaille dans certains des endroits les plus difficiles du monde, pour atteindre les enfants les plus défavorisés du monde. Pour sauver leur vie. Pour défendre leurs droits. Pour les aider à réaliser leur potentiel.\nDans 190 pays et territoires, nous travaillons pour chaque enfant, partout, tous les jours, afin de construire un monde meilleur pour tous.\nEt nous n'abandonnons jamais.\nPour chaque enfant, Droits\nL'Enquête par grappes à indicateurs multiples (MICS) est un programme international d'enquête sur les ménages élaboré et appuyé par l'UNICEF. MICS est conçue pour recueillir des estimations sur les indicateurs clés qui sont utilisés pour évaluer la situation des enfants et des femmes. Au cours des 30 dernières années, MICS a évolué pour répondre aux besoins changeants en matière de données, passant de 28 indicateurs au premier cycle à 250 indicateurs au cours du septième cycle actuel et est devenue une source importante de données sur la protection de l'enfance et l'éducation de la petite enfance et une source majeure de données sur la santé et la nutrition des enfants. En plus d'être un outil de collecte de données permettant de générer des données pour suivre les progrès vers les objectifs nationaux et les engagements mondiaux visant à promouvoir le bien-être des enfants, les MICS ont fourni des données précieuses pour les Objectifs du Millénaire pour le Développement (OMD) et fournissent actuellement des données pour le suivi et l'établissement de rapports sur les Objectifs de Développement Durable (ODD).Depuis le lancement des MICS dans les années 1990, plus de 350 enquêtes ont été réalisées dans 118 pays. Dans le cadre des efforts mondiaux visant à développer davantage les capacités nationales de production et d’analyse de données de haute qualité et désagrégées, l’UNICEF a lancé la septième série des MICS en 2023, les résultats des premières enquêtes sont disponibles. Ce nouveau cycle est en accord avec la liste des indicateurs des Objectifs de Développement Durable approuvés par la Commission de statistique des Nations Unies en 2016, à la suite de l'adoption mondiale des 17 ODD et des 169 objectifs de l’Agenda pour le Développement Durable de 2030. Le cadre définitif des indicateurs des ODD comprend actuellement 231 indicateurs mondiaux, dont environ un tiers repose sur des enquêtes auprès des ménages. La MICS est bien placée pour jouer un rôle central dans cet agenda, parallèlement à d'autres enquêtes clés démographiques, sanitaires et socio-économiques, et compléter les données provenant de sources administratives et de recensements. Après avoir fait l'objet d'un travail méthodologique et de validation rigoureux pour élargir la portée des outils et inclure de nouveaux thèmes qui reflètent les indicateurs des ODD et les nouveaux enjeux dans le contexte de l’Agenda 2030 pour le Développement Durable, les questionnaires MICS7 du nouveau cycle couvrent environ la moitié des indicateurs des ODD fondés sur des enquêtes auprès des ménages.  ToR enquete MICS.docx\nComment pouvez-vous faire une différence ? \n Fournir un soutien technique et de gestion à l'enquête MICS ; Présenter la méthodologie MICS, les outils et les lignes directrices aux partenaires / parties prenantes (par exemple, ministères, agences des Nations Unies, etc.) ; Finaliser, en collaboration avec les partenaires nationaux et le Bureau Pays de l'UNICEF, le plan de l'enquête et le budget, y compris le calendrier et les partager avec le Coordonnateur Régional MICS ; Veiller à ce que le Protocole d'éthique et les autres recommandations éthiques soient pris en compte dans le processus de mise en œuvre de l'enquête et que tous les documents relatifs à la MICS soient partagés avec le comité d'éthique national/international à temps pour approbation ; Superviser chaque étape du processus d'enquête et s'assurer que les protocoles et les normes MICS sont suivis par l'INSTAD, plus précisément pendant les visites de formation et de supervision sur le terrain ;\n Communiquer régulièrement avec le Bureau Pays et/ou l’Équipe MICS de l’UNICEF, pour répondre en temps opportun à toutes les questions relatives à la MICS ; Fournir des mises à jour mensuelles sur les activités de la MICS au Bureau de l’UNICEF, l’INSTAD et au Coordonnateur Régional de la MICS ; Appuyer la coordination du travail des spécialistes de l’INSTAD et de l'équipe MICS de l'UNICEF, ainsi que d'autres personnes ressources désignées par le Bureau Pays de l'UNICEF et/ou l'équipe MICS de l'UNICEF pour soutenir les différentes étapes de l'enquête ; Veiller à ce que des examens techniques externes effectués par des experts (c'est-à-dire des experts et des consultants en matière d'échantillonnage, de traitement des données et d'enquêtes sur les ménages) soient réalisés à des étapes clés de l'enquête et coordonner le retour d'information et la réponse entre le Bureau Pays, l'équipe MICS de l'UNICEF et l'INSTAD ; S'assurer que tous les documents et manuels liés à l'enquête sont bien archivés tout au long du processus de l'enquête (par exemple, le protocole d'entente, le plan d'enquête et le budget, les questionnaires, les manuels, le plan d'échantillonnage, les rapports de formation et de pre-test, les rapports d’experts, les applications CAPI, les tableaux de qualité du terrain, le plan de tabulation, les tableaux, les syntaxes des tableaux, les fichiers de données, les géocodes des grappes, le fichier de forme des limites, le rapport de résultats de l'enquête , les résumés statistiques, les documents de dissémination, etc.) ; Participer à toutes les réunions du Comité de Pilotage et du Comité technique de la MICS ; Participer aux ateliers régionaux MICS et y contribuer ; Appuyer l’organisation, le cas échéant, et la facilitation de l'atelier national d'interprétation des données et de compilation des rapports  S'assurer qu’en accord avec les parties prenantes nationales, les leçons apprises, les problèmes et les bonnes pratiques sont documentés tout au long du processus MICS et rapidement partagés avec la communauté MICS (autres pays de mise en œuvre de MICS ainsi que l’équipe MICS de l’UNICEF) par tous les moyens disponibles ;

For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF has over 12,000 staff in more than 145 countries.\nBACKGROUND\nPurpose of Activity/Assignment:\nThe Education Outcomes Fund (EOF), in collaboration with the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) of Rwanda and the National Child Development Agency (NCDA), is launching a programme with the objective of improving child development and school readiness outcomes for children aged 3 – 5 years in community-based ECD centres. To do so, the programme will uplift the quality of existing community based ECD centres and create an environment conducive to early learning, setting the stage for continued educational attainment as these children progress through the education system.  \nThe programme uses Outcomes Based Finance (OBF) where payments are made to Grantees upon the achievement of pre-defined results. Under this model, pre-defined results are verified by an independent third-party evaluator, and payments are triggered only when results are achieved.  \nThe programme's outcomes encompass multiple dimensions of ECCE. For this programme, the evaluation of results will focus on the following outcomes of interest:   \n• Quality of ECD centers including both structural and process quality.  \n• Holistic child development outcomes.  \nIn addition to the points above, the programme will focus on improving learning and school readiness of children aged 3-5 with extra focus on children with disability. The programme will work in three geographic lots, and each selected grantee will be assigned to a single lot of at least 130 centres. \nScope of Work:\nThe consultant will provide strategic and technical guidance to EOF on the management of EOF’s early childhood programme in Rwanda.  \nTerms of Reference / Deliverables\nDeliver at least 15 workshops for government partners and implementing partners on the EOF program in Rwanda.

    "jobDescription": "UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential. \nAcross 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone. \nAnd we never give up. \nPour chaque enfant, l'engagement \nL'UNICEF travaille au Cameroun depuis 1975 pour permettre aux femmes et aux enfants d'exercer pleinement leur droit au développement sans restriction, tel qu'il est inscrit dans la Convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits de l'enfant. L'UNICEF apporte un soutien financier et technique au Cameroun dans sept domaines afin de réaliser pleinement les droits des femmes et des enfants. Ces domaines comprennent la santé, le VIH/SIDA, l'eau, l'assainissement et l'hygiène, la nutrition, l'éducation, la protection de l'enfance et l'inclusion sociale. L'UNICEF se concentre principalement sur les enfants et les familles les plus vulnérables et les plus exclues. La population du Cameroun en 2020 est estimée à 26 545 863 personnes selon les données de l'ONU. La population est jeune et génère une forte demande socio-économique. Dans les zones rurales, l'accès limité aux services sociaux de base et les effets du changement climatique conduisent à l'appauvrissement des ménages et à de graves privations pour les enfants. La tâche est immense mais pas insurmontable ; elle nécessite l'énergie de tous les acteurs au Cameroun et hors du Cameroun : aussi, les femmes, les hommes, les jeunes et les enfants, le gouvernement, les partenaires techniques et financiers, les bailleurs de fonds, la société civile, le secteur privé, les parlementaires et les communautés. Chacun est invité à participer à la lutte pour relever les défis qui nous attendent. Ensemble, nous agirons pour le Cameroun, un pays qui résume les défis et les espoirs de l'Afrique.\nPour en savoir plus sur l'UNICEF Cameroun, utilisez le lien ci-dessous :\nhttps://unicef.sharepoint.com/sites/CMR/SitePages/AboutUs.aspx\n \nComment pouvez-vous faire la différence? \nBackground:\nAu Cameroun, la structure de la chaîne d’approvisionnement en vaccin du pays épouse celle de la pyramidale du système de santé.  La distribution est basée sur un système « push » pour les régions et un système « pull » pour les districts et les établissements de santé.\nTous les approvisionnements en vaccin du PEV transitent par la division des approvisionnements de l’UNICEF. Le niveau central reçoit tous les vaccins du programme et les distribue au niveau intermédiaire (région), qui lui aussi les distribue en fonction des besoins et des opportunités aux niveaux opérationnels, notamment les districts, chez qui les formations sanitaires viendront s’approvisionner selon un calendrier établi de commun accord.\nLes données du dernier inventaire (2022) montrent que 43 % des établissements de santé (2 234/5 257) offrent encore des services de vaccination sans équipements de chaîne du froid (ECF) homologués. L'analyse a été réalisée à l'aide de l'outil d'inventaire et d'analyse des lacunes de l'OMS. Sur la base de cet inventaire et compte tenu des futurs vaccins à introduire (HepB, MenA, RR2, VPI2, RTS, S, passage du Rotarix au Rotavac), le pays a élaboré un plan de réhabilitation couvrant la période 2023-2025.\nPour 2023, 749 ECF sont en cours d'acquisition et leur déploiement est prévu grâce à différentes sources de financement (RSS2, CDS3, Africa CDC, gouvernement). Le pays vient également de bénéficier d’un subvention USD 8 303 436 pour l’achat de 1590 réfrigérateurs avec l’appui technique de l’UNICEF.\nLe Cameroun a été le premier pays d'Afrique à mener en 2019 une évaluation de la Gestion Efficace des Vaccins (GEV) avec la version 2.0. Le score composite était de 81 %. Cette performance reflète la fiabilité de la chaîne d'approvisionnement du pays. Dans l'ensemble, les mesures d'amélioration sont surtout nécessaires au niveau des districts et des établissements de santé, où les scores composites sont inférieurs à 80 %. Le plan d'amélioration présenté couvre la période 2023-2025 et ne semble pas lié à l'évaluation de 2019. Le pays a indiqué qu'il se préparait à une nouvelle évaluation de la GEV prévue pour 2024.\nToutes ces insuffisances entrainant parfois des pertes de vaccins importantes au niveau des dépôts régionaux, des districts et des FOSA, ce qui représente des pertes financières élevées pour le programme. \nPar ailleurs, le pays envisage la construction d’un entrepôt géant du PEV au niveau Central et devra mettre en œuvre deux subventions de Gavi sur la période 2024-2025 : le portefeuille complet, l’introduction du HPV, de la deuxième dose de VPI, en routine et la plateforme d’optimisation de la chaine du froid (CCEOP), tous devant contribuer considérablement à l’amélioration des approvisionnements en vaccins et l’augmentation de la capacité de stockage.\nAu vu des enjeux considérables à la mise en œuvre de ces importantes activités et bien d’autres, un appui technique qualifié spécialisé en chaine du froid et gestion du vaccin nécessaire tant au niveau du bureau UNICEF qu’au niveau du PEV.\nAfin d’aider le pays à minimiser toutes ces insuffisances et de manière conséquente les pertes en vaccin, le bureau UNICEF, avec l’appui des autres partenaires (GAVI, Africa CDC), se propose de poursuivre l’appui technique de la section santé aux équipes du PEV, en recrutant un consultant national en logistique et chaine du froid (CCL) hautement qualifié.

In order to protect the lives, health and well-being of children and strengthen the resilience and capacity of their communities to adapt essential social services to a changing climate, more frequent/extreme disasters and a degrading environment, a comprehensive child-inclusive subnational risk assessment along with data systems and policies that work across development and disaster management to identify and prioritize the most vulnerable children and services are needed. This data and analysis can be used to inform multiple purposes: disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, preparedness planning, and wider development agendas.\nThe availability of coherent, accessible, and updated information is considered a priority to inform decision makers and promote processes of climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and more sustained and resilient development. Those efforts should be based on a shared analysis of risks, including multiple shocks and stresses threats, both natural and man-made threats, and using an integrated, multi-sectoral approach. This will facilitate planning and prioritization of risk areas and a better understanding of the underlying causes of increased risk levels.\nEswatini faces significant challenges from climate change, including more frequent and intense droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. The country’s reliance on rain-fed agriculture makes it particularly sensitive to shifts in rainfall patterns, while water scarcity in the drier lowveld regions exacerbates these vulnerabilities. Hydrological disasters, such as prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall, and severe storms, have led to compromised agricultural productivity, directly affecting food security and economic stability. Given that a large portion of the population depends on agriculture for both employment and subsistence, these climate-related challenges threaten livelihoods and the overall resilience of communities across the country. Eswatini is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to a combination of political, geographic, and social factors, ranking 137th out of 181 countries in the 2020 ND-GAIN Index. A lower ranking indicates a country’s greater vulnerability, while a higher score reflects greater preparedness to improve resilience. In recent years, Eswatini has experienced significant fluctuations in rainfall patterns, along with recurring droughts. These changes are expected to increasingly threaten agricultural production, particularly for smallholder farmers and rural communities. Land degradation and soil erosion, intensified by heavy rains, further heighten the vulnerability of the over 70% of the population that depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Decreased precipitation and prolonged drought periods are also anticipated to negatively impact the agricultural and livestock sectors. Drought risk is a particularly pressing concern. The aftermath of severe droughts has left 25% of the population vulnerable and currently experiencing food and water insecurity, with many households still dependent on welfare and social safety nets for survival. As a result, families face loss of livelihoods, children face disruption of education and limited access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, health and nutrition, and child protection services. There is also a greater risk of exploitation, abuse, violence, and family separation. The CCRI-DRM is a composite index that helps to understand and measure the likelihood that climate, environmental and other types of shocks and stresses lead to the erosion of development progress, the deepening of deprivations, and humanitarian crisis that affect children and vulnerable households and groups. It seeks to identify which areas are at risk of deepening child deprivations and humanitarian situations affecting children because of their exposure to these shocks and stresses, and to understand the underlying factors that could contribute to these risks. Emphasis will be placed on the use of the CCRI-DRM assessment model and the interactive platform, providing direct technical assistance to government institutions to include child sensitive climate and disaster risk data and analysis in their planning and programming procedures. The overall objectives of the CCRI-DRM are to support the establishment of a national-led, multistakeholder framework on the nexus between children’s climate and disaster risks and the development of their full potential in Eswatini. The CCRI-DRM subnational assessment is envisaged to capture the following components: • A subnational Children’s Climate Risk Index - Disaster Risk Model for Eswatini;• An interactive platform making the CCRI-DRM model and underlying indicator data, as well as other relevant indicators open source and publicly accessible. • A multi-stakeholder technical platform guiding the production and update of the CCRI-DRM and the analysis and use of its’ results. • A CCRI-DRM analytical report to support the alignment and coordination of planning and programming efforts of national actors with informed by identified child vulnerabilities and risks from climate, environmental and other shocks and stresses and climate changes.• The promotion and facilitation of the use of evidence on climate, environmental and disaster risks to support climate change mitigation and adaptation, emergency preparedness and response, disaster risk reduction, resilient development.\nThe purpose of this assignment is for a consultant to support UNICEF and the Government of Eswatini in developing the Eswatini Children’s Climate Risk Index -Disaster Risk Model (CCRI-DRM) at sub-national level. For this assignment, the consultant will work with UNICEF and relevant government and non-government partners to identify, compile and analyze existing data sources and platforms to capture 1) climate and disaster risk and 2) vulnerability, especially for children, families, and their communities to these risks at the national and regional/sub-regional level. Subsequently, an interactive open-source visualization platform presenting the subnational risk model and underlying indicators data will be embedded or developed with support from UNICEF that will assist with prioritization and planning for risk mitigation and adaptation – as well as inform preparedness and investment priorities.\nScope of Work:\nThe consultant will support the Government of Eswatini and UNICEF in developing a child-sensitive subnational disaster risk model and interactive platform (CCRI-DRM). This platform will integrate data on children's exposure and vulnerability to climate, environmental, and other hazards to inform planning, emergency preparedness, and resilience-building across sectors.Key tasks include:• Coordinating with a multi-stakeholder Technical Working Group (TWG) to guide the model design and implementation.• Assessing national capacity and existing data systems for risk and vulnerability analysis.• Reviewing and compiling data from various sectors to construct the CCRI-DRM model, aligned with global UNICEF methodologies.• Building and validating the first version of the CCRI-DRM index and platform.• Supporting sector-specific analysis (e.g., health, education, WASH).• Providing training to national stakeholders to ensure sustainability and future updates.• Facilitating the integration of the model into an interactive platform for public and institutional use.The consultant will work under UNICEF’s guidance and collaborate closely with government ministries, particularly the NDMA, MOH, and other partners \n\n\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nDeliverables / Outputs\n\n\nDelivery Deadline\n\n\nEstimated Budget Share\n\n\n\n\n1.

By implementing the TrackFin methodology, Malawi aims to map WASH financial flows comprehensively and comparably. This initiative will enhance financial transparency, improve resource allocation, support informed decision-making, strengthen accountability, and contribute to sustainable development goals.\nThe TrackFin methodology was developed to support the collection and mapping of WASH financial flows, in a comprehensive and comparable manner. The resulting outputs are called WASH accounts which aim to answer four key questions:\n\nWhat is the total expenditure in the WASH sector?\nWhat are the funds being spent on?\nWho pays for WASH services and how much do they pay?\nWho are the main WASH service providers and how much are they spending?\n\nCountries generally collect data covering two to three years of WASH expenditure data in a single WASH accounts cycle from all available sources (including government, donors, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs), service providers, financial institutions and household expenditure surveys) and covering all cost types (including capital investment, operations and maintenance, and support costs). To develop WASH accounts, the WASH accounts focal point and team use the WASH Accounts Production Tool (WAPT), a software tool that supports the mapping of expenditure data and automates production of standard WASH accounts indicators and tables.\nWASH accounts development follows the five steps outlined below.\n\nMobilize support: This includes mobilizing political support, setting up the institutional arrangements to develop WASH accounts and identifying required financial resources.\nPlan and prepare for implementation: This includes identifying data requirements and data sources and developing the WASH accounts implementation plan and data collection plan.\nCollect and prepare data: This includes preparing materials for data collection; setting up the reference study in the WAPT modules 1, 2 and 3; collecting data; processing, formatting and finalizing the data and documenting data gaps and opportunities to improve data in the WASH accounts implementation summary.\nMap data and finalize WASH accounts: This includes uploading all data and mapping expenditures in the WAPT, exporting standard outputs in module 6, finalizing and validating the WASH accounts results and then developing products to share results.\nDisseminate findings and plan for the next WASH accounts cycle: This includes presenting results to key policy- and decision-makers and the WASH sector, discussing use of results and completing the WASH accounts implementation summary including initial plans for a subsequent cycle.\n\nHow can you make a difference? \nThe WASH Accounts Financing Consultant will be responsible for the following:\n\nSupport the WASH accounts development process: Oversee the process from inception to the generation of final WASH accounts and products.\nOrganize and facilitate meetings and workshops: Coordinate and manage logistics for meetings and workshops as requested.\nDevelop implementation and data collection plans: Create comprehensive plans for implementing WASH accounts and collecting necessary data.\nCollect and prepare data: Gather data from various sources, review, clean, and prepare it for import into the WAPT.\nUse the WAPT for data import and mapping: Set up studies, import data, and map expenditures using the WAPT.\nFinalize WASH accounts: Complete the WASH accounts based on inputs from WHO technical reviews and support validation of results.\nPrepare WASH accounts products: Develop policy briefs, and presentations for sharing results including identification or regulatory gaps.\nPromote the use of WASH accounts: Engage with national decision-makers to disseminate results and encourage the use of WASH accounts.\nDocument implementation processes: Record lessons learned and plans for improvements in the implementation summary.\n\nTo qualify as an advocate for every child you will have… \nAcademic Qualification\n\n\n\nA degree in a relevant field such as Finance, Public Finance, Economics, or a related discipline is required.\n\n\n\nWork Experience\n\n\n\nAt least 7 years’ work experience in public finance management (PFM), including costing, financial data analysis, economic modelling or related fields is required.\nExperience with data collection, analysis, and reporting is advantageous.\nExperience with WASH/Health sectors has a strong advantage.\nFamiliarity with the WASH Accounts Production Tool (WAPT) or similar tools is an advantage.\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills, Knowledge, and Competencies\n\n\n\nStrong analytical and data management skills are advantageous.\nProficiency in using data analysis software and tools, particularly Excel, is required.\nKnowledge of WASH financing and national monitoring processes is advantageous\nKnowledge of the functioning of budgeting and financial management systems, including the programme- based budgeting system (PBBS), integrated financial management system (IFMIS) and chart of accounts (CoA) as applied in Malawi is advantageous.\nExcellent communication and facilitation skills are required.\nAbility to work collaboratively with diverse stakeholders is required.\n\n\n\n Languages: Fluency in English and Chichewa (strong oral & written skills) required.\nPlease refer to the attached full Terms of Reference  Terms of Reference_National WASH Accounts Finance Consultant .pdf for more details on the consultancy and requirements.\nFor every Child, you demonstrate… \nUNICEF's values of Care, Respect, Integrity, Trust, Accountability, and Sustainability (CRITAS).   \nTo view our competency framework, please visit  here. \nUNICEF is committed to diversity and inclusion within its workforce, and encourages all candidates, irrespective of gender, nationality, religious or ethnic background, and persons with disabilities, to apply to become a part of the organization.

    "jobDescription": "Spread the loveFully Funded Hauwa Ojeifo Scholarship 2025 for Young Leaders Empowering Women and Girls (Attend One Young World Summit in Germany)\nIntroduction\nGender inequality continues to be one of the greatest challenges of our time. Despite global efforts, women and girls—especially across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East—face persistent disparities in health, rights, and opportunity. Mental health stigma, gender-based violence, child marriage, and limited reproductive rights remain widespread. To address these deeply interconnected issues, the Hauwa Ojeifo Scholarship 2025 has been launched in partnership with One Young World and the Hauwa Ojeifo Global Impact Fund for Women & Girls.\nAbout the Hauwa Ojeifo Scholarship\nThe Hauwa Ojeifo Scholarship was created to support and empower young changemakers working at the intersection of gender equality, mental health, disability inclusion, and sexual and reproductive rights. The scholarship equips leaders with tools, knowledge, mentorship, funding opportunities, and global visibility to drive meaningful action in their communities.\nThis initiative honors the work of Hauwa Ojeifo, a Nigerian mental health advocate and founder of She Writes Woman, who transformed her personal experience with bipolar disorder and PTSD into a national movement for mental health rights in Nigeria.\nWho is it for?\nThe scholarship is intended for young leaders aged 18–30, though exceptions are made for outstanding candidates over 30. Eligible applicants must:\n\nLive in and be making an impact in Africa, Asia, or the Middle East.\n\nBe actively involved in initiatives or organizations addressing one or more of the following issues:\n\nMental Health (including neurodivergence and psychosocial disabilities)\nDomestic and Sexual Violence\nDisability Rights\nSexual & Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR)\nMaternal and Child Health\nIssues of the Girl Child (e.g., FGM, child marriage, adolescent pregnancy)\nNon-Communicable Diseases\n\n\n\nApplicants whose projects integrate psychosocial support and a disability-inclusive lens are especially encouraged to apply.\nWhat Does the Scholarship Offer?\nSelected scholars will receive:\n\nFull funding to attend the One Young World Summit 2025, taking place in Munich, Germany from 3–6 November 2025.\nLifetime membership in the One Young World Ambassador network.\nAccess to the One Young World Action Accelerator and expert-led mentorship sessions.\nThe opportunity to apply for grants of up to $25,000 USD to scale their initiatives.\n\nThis platform is not only a recognition of the scholar’s work but a springboard for expanding impact globally.\nWhy It Matters\nAt the current rate, it will take 300 years to end child marriage. Nearly one in five girls are married before their 18th birthday, and close to half of married women lack decision-making power over their sexual health. These injustices are compounded by poor access to mental health services and limited representation of women and girls with disabilities. The Hauwa Ojeifo Scholarship responds to these urgent challenges by investing in the leadership of those most impacted—and most driven to create change.\nApplication Deadline\nDeadline: 29 June 2025\nAPPLY NOW\nConclusion\nThe Hauwa Ojeifo Scholarship 2025 is more than just a funded trip to an international summit—it’s a transformative experience for young leaders with the courage to drive gender equity, normalize mental health care, and advocate for disability rights. If you’re working to change lives and challenge systems of oppression in your community, this is your chance to bring your mission to a global stage.\nFor more opportunities Visit Here"

    "jobDescription": "Spread the loveWater Hackathon 2025: €5,000 Prize for Safe Water Innovation in Coastal Bangladesh\nAre you ready to revolutionize access to safe water in one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions? The Water Hackathon 2025, organized by BRAC with support from IRC, is calling on innovators, entrepreneurs, community members, researchers, and organizations from Bangladesh and around the globe to tackle the pressing water crisis in coastal Bangladesh.\nThis global call to action offers participants the opportunity to win up to €5,000, see their solution implemented on the ground, and contribute to sustainable change for millions living in climate hotspots.\n\nBackground: The Water Crisis in Coastal Bangladesh\nBangladesh’s coastal regions face worsening water insecurity due to salinity intrusion, contaminated water sources, and inadequate infrastructure. The country’s geographic vulnerability, coupled with frequent cyclones and flooding, has left millions without reliable access to clean drinking water. Traditional water systems often fail under environmental stress, and poor infrastructure further limits the reach of existing solutions.\nWhile some technologies like Pond Sand Filters (PSFs) have been introduced, their limited coverage leaves many still relying on unsafe sources. Financial barriers, insufficient technological adaptation, and the lack of community-driven approaches have stalled broader progress.\nTo address these issues, the Equitable and Sustainable WASH Services in Bangladesh Delta Plan Hotspots Project was launched. The initiative—running from 2022 to 2026—aims to enhance WASH services for 1 million people across 45 sub-districts in 14 climate-affected districts. The Water Hackathon 2025 is a key component of this effort.\n\nWhat Is the Water Hackathon?\nThe Water Hackathon 2025 is an innovation challenge designed to develop practical, affordable, and culturally appropriate solutions for the water crisis in coastal Bangladesh. It is a hybrid event, encouraging cross-sector collaboration and community-led innovation.\nParticipants can submit ideas at any stage of development—ideation, pilot, or scaled implementation—as long as they meet key criteria: community-led co-creation, innovation, impact, feasibility, and scalability.\n\nWho Can Apply?\nThe hackathon is open to everyone, regardless of geographic location. Applicants may include:\n\nLocal communities from coastal Bangladesh\nLocal entrepreneurs and water sector start-ups\nUniversity students and academic teams\nResearchers and professionals\nNGOs, CBOs, and social enterprises\nInternational applicants with relevant solutions\n\nThis inclusive approach ensures that diverse voices, especially those with lived experience in affected regions, contribute to the development of sustainable water solutions.\n\nAwards and Benefits\nTwo winning teams will be awarded:\n\nWinner: €5,000 and the opportunity to pilot their idea in a coastal district\nFirst Runner-up: €3,000\nCertificates and crests for all shortlisted participants\n\nAdditional benefits:\n\nMedia coverage and recognition on IRC platforms\nMentorship and implementation support\nA chance to contribute to national and global water innovation\n\n\nKey Dates to Remember\n\nApplication Deadline: 30 June 2025\nPitch Event (Hybrid): 15 July 2025\n\nIn-person pitches for those in Dhaka\nVirtual presentations for participants outside Dhaka\n\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\nTo submit your solution, complete the Google Form here\nFor queries or support, contact this Email\nLearn more about the host initiative here: here\n\nWhy This Matters\nThe Water Hackathon 2025 is not just about ideas—it’s about impact, ownership, and resilience. By empowering communities and bridging technical expertise with local insight, this initiative paves the way for sustainable water security in one of the world’s most vulnerable regions.\nDo you have a water solution that can make a difference?
