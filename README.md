# Easy Apply - Intelligent Job Application System

## Overview

Easy Apply is a sophisticated job application automation system that combines web scraping, AI-powered document processing, and intelligent job matching. The system helps job seekers optimize their application materials (resumes and cover letters) for specific job postings while maintaining a continuous pipeline of new job opportunities.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Backend Server (Go)**
   - Main application server built with Go
   - Handles HTTP requests, file processing, and AI integrations
   - Manages job data synchronization and storage
   - Implements server-sent events (SSE) for real-time progress updates

2. **Frontend Client (React)**
   - Modern React application with TypeScript
   - Real-time UI updates and interactive components
   - Resume preview and editing capabilities
   - Job recommendation interface

3. **Job Scraper**
   - Automated job listing collection from multiple sources
   - Periodic scraping with configurable intervals
   - Differential updates to track new job postings
   - Detail enrichment for job listings

4. **AI Processing (OpenAI Integration)**
   - Resume optimization
   - Cover letter generation
   - Job detail extraction
   - Industry and domain classification

5. **Data Storage**
   - Firebase/Firestore for document and user data
   - Local JSON storage for job scraping results
   - Caching system for AI responses

## Data Flow

### 1. Job Discovery Pipeline

```
Web Sources → Node.js Scraper → JSON Storage → Go Server → Firestore
                                     ↓
                            Differential Analysis
                                     ↓
                            New Job Notifications
```

- Job scraper runs every 10 minutes (configurable)
- Compares current jobs with previous scrape results
- Stores new jobs for processing
- Enriches job details with additional information

### 2. Document Processing Pipeline

```
User Upload → File Service → PDF/Doc Processing → OpenAI Analysis → Enhanced Documents
    ↓             ↓                  ↓                    ↓               ↓
Progress    Format Validation    Text Extraction    AI Optimization   Storage/Delivery
Updates
```

- Supports multiple document formats
- Extracts text content while preserving structure
- Processes documents through OpenAI with retry logic
- Implements caching to optimize API usage

### 3. Job Matching System

```
Resume Analysis → Industry/Domain Classification → Job Requirements Matching
      ↓                        ↓                            ↓
Skill Extraction    Recommendation Generation        Score Calculation
```

- Uses ML models to analyze resume content
- Classifies candidates into industry domains
- Matches skills and experience with job requirements
- Generates personalized job recommendations
